          Early years, 1830–1910 Origins The illusion of films is based on the
          optical phenomena known as persistence of vision and the phi
          phenomenon. The first of these causes the brain to retain images cast
          upon the retina of the eye for a fraction of a second beyond their
          disappearance from the field of sight, while the latter creates
          apparent movement between images when they succeed one another
          rapidly. Together these phenomena permit the succession of still
          frames on a film strip to represent continuous movement when projected
          at the proper speed (traditionally 16 frames per second for silent
          films and 24 frames per second for sound films). Before the invention
          of photography, a variety of optical toys exploited this effect by
          mounting successive phase drawings of things in motion on the face of
          a twirling disk (the phenakistoscope, c. 1832) or inside a rotating
          drum (the zoetrope, c. 1834).

          Hobbies were originally described as pursuits that others thought
          somewhat childish or trivial. However, as early as 1676 Sir Matthew
          Hale, in Contemplations Moral and Divine, wrote "Almost every person
          hath some hobby horse or other wherein he prides himself." He was
          acknowledging that a "hobby horse" produces a legitimate sense of
          pride. By the mid 18th century there was a flourishing of hobbies as
          working people had more regular hours of work and greater leisure
          time. They spent more time to purs…

          The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years, although
          the earliest origins are uncertain. The earliest predecessor of the
          game probably originated in India, by the 7th century AD. From India,
          the game spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was
          taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern
          Europe. In Europe, chess evolved into roughly its current for…

          Music is found in every known society, past and present, and is
          considered to be a cultural universal. Since all people of the world,
          including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it
          may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the
          ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the
          world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa

      1. Stay true to yourself. So much unhappiness stems from making decisions
      that go against what you know in your core, your gut, to be right. Deep
      down, you don't want to do it--but you do it anyway. You listen to your
      head. You try to convince yourself the raise is worth it, or the risk is
      too great, or it's better to just stay put, to keep your head down.
      Staying true to yourself is a challenge, yes. But effectively suppressing
      your true self is even more challenging. 2. Do what you love--not what
      you're told to love. To spend time (especially a considerable amount of
      time) doing what you love takes work. Hard work. And the truth is, most
      people give up. They get a job to pay the bills and do what they love "on
      the side." Eventually, they lose motivation, fall into the comfort of
      routine, and give up the very thing they once valued the most. And for
      years, then, they look back in regret, almost basking in the statement, "I
      wish I could have...". It might take a while for you to realize it, but at
      some point you will. You will feel an immense sense of loss for not having
      stuck with the thing that once brought you true joy. Even if you never
      make it your career. Even if you only do it for yourself, still, do it.
      The fact that "doing something for yourself" is seen as a waste of time
      and energy is testament enough to our achievement-based society. 3. Create
      the environment that's right for you. If you are an extrovert, don't allow
      yourself to work a job that suppresses that part of you. If you are an
      introvert, don't try to contort yourself to an extroverted company
      culture. Your own happiness is a reflection of your day-to-day, the things
      you're doing, and most important, how you are doing them. Create your own
      environment. Put yourself in a place that will help you grow, not suppress
      your growth. Surround yourself with people who understand, or at least
      make the effort to understand you. There are always options. Do not settle
      for someplace that does not feed your core. 4. Choose your friends wisely.
      You are a reflection of the five people you spend the most time
      with--choose them wisely. If they complain a lot, you will inevitably
      complain a lot. If they are lazy, you will become lazy. If they are not
      actively improving themselves, you will not actively improve
      yourself--unless you leave the situation and find others who will reflect
      that part of you. It is very difficult to remain in a state of happiness
      when you are surrounded by negativity. 5. Develop positive habits. We as
      humans like to believe "happiness" is the destination wherein there is no
      more challenge. Everything is easy. In fact, it is quite the opposite. We
      love challenge. We thrive off challenge. We grow through challenge. We
      discover ourselves by being challenged. And it is not the thing itself,
      but your emotional state that decides whether or not that process of
      growing and being challenged is enjoyable, in the same way a workout can
      be enjoyable or grueling and painful (in the same way a workout to someone
      out of shape can be grueling and painful). The simple act of developing
      positive habits in itself brings a deeply "earned" happiness. We are happy
      because we have overcome ourselves. 6. Create certainty and leave room for
      uncertainty. If everything in your life is planned out, then it's boring.
      If nothing in your life is planned out, then it's risky and uneasy.
      Happiness is found somewhere in the middle. You want just enough certainty
      in your life to feel like you have ground to stand on, you're not
      completely in danger, but you've left the window open for spontaneity to
      sneak in for a sleepover every now and then. It's the spontaneous
      adventures that bring extreme moments of joy. But they are best enjoyed
      when you know you have something safe to land on as well. 7. Be
      vulnerable. Frightening, but there is an unrivaled happiness that comes
      through acts of vulnerability. These moments confirm we are human. That we
      are imperfect. We open ourselves and, as if looking in the mirror for the
      first time, are able to step back and see who we are a bit more
      clearly--for better or worse. We accept ourselves, and let others do the
      same. Vulnerability is the secret. We as a society go to great lengths to
      hide who we are, and create masks, personas, and images to portray the
      parts we know will receive approval--while banishing the rest to the
      shadows. But all our best work comes from being vulnerable. All our
      happiest moments and saddest realizations come from being vulnerable. All
      our deepest loves and greatest friendships come from being vulnerable. All
      our art, all our music, all our creativity comes from being vulnerable.
      Vulnerability is the secret to happiness--and that is why I started this
      article with the breath. Happiness is not out there somewhere, waiting for
      you. Happiness is hidden within vulnerability, and vulnerability is hidden
      within you.
